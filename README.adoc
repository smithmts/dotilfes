== Included Configurations

* https://www.vim.org/[Vim]
* https://neovim.io/[Neovim]
* https://zsh.sourceforge.io/[Zsh]

== Goals / Guiding Principals

=== Vim

For scenarios I may find myself in someday where I have access to Vim but not Neovim.
No plugins (except built-ins).

=== Neovim

My main PDE and local writing environment.
I'm seeking to be conservative, and only add plug-ins/features when I feel like I grasp how to cope without them and how they add value.

=== Zsh

My main shell.

Minimal in on-screen elements and overall complexity.

Only use plugins that can be installed via Pacman.  No frameworks, no plugin managers if I can help it.

== Known Dependencies
